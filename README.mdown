# .dotfiles

## How to use:
in.sh - Copies your personal version of the dotfiles into this directory.

out.sh - Copies the dotfiles in this directory to your home folder. 

## Warnings
These files are made to work on Ubuntu 12.04. .bashrc is based on the stock Ubuntu .bashrc. I advise against using this on any other platform. On other systems, please copy and paste individual lines as you need them.
